# Blotto Tracker in Python via CSV

I programmed the backend for the Colonel Blotto game in Python, such that in the Terminal/Command-line my application when ran (metric.py) would display the current winning strategy and request a solution from the user that not only beats the winning strategy, but all past winning strategies. If the user gives a true winning strategy, it would be added to a CSV file and displayed as the new winning strategy in the next run. If the user gives a losing strategy, the script will display all past winning strategies that the userâ€™s suggested strategy lost to for easier refinement. All winning strategies were written to a csv file (Armies.csv), such that each row with a strategy beats all previous rows. After some time and refining my solution while utilizing my code to ensure wins over all my past strategies, I concluded with (0, 5, 5, 21, 22, 1, 30, 14, 1, 1). Overall, I still focused on allocating majority of my soldiers to both castles 4 and 5 to prevent any individuals aiming for an immediate 20+ points, while allocating majority soldiers to also castles 7 and 8 to ensure large point gains after stopping aggressive attacks/castle losts. I chose to place only 1 soldier at castles 9 and 10 each in case of ties. 

To play, run metric.py via python metric.py in a shell. If you would like to play against one other person/player, you can run python twoPlayer.py
